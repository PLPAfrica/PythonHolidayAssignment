### Explanation:

- The `read_numbers` function reads a list of numbers from the user.
- Functions like `calculate_sum`, `calculate_average`, `find_maximum`, and `find_minimum` perform basic statistical operations on the list.
- The `filter_even_numbers` function filters out even numbers from the list.
- The `main` function orchestrates the execution by calling the necessary functions.
